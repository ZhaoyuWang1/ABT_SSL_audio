Research proposal: adaptation of [Barlow Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230) [Zbontar _et al._, 2021] for audio data, using a Transformer encoder with masking of one of the two views, inspired by the recent work of Assran _et al._, in [Masked Siamese Networks for Label-Efficient Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07141).
